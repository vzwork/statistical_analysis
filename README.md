<h1>Analyse Two Phone Plans</h1>

GOAL: 
- Compare two phone plans - "Smart", "Ultra".
- Find out which one is more profitable.

DATA:
- 500 user and data about them

STEPS:
1. open files and look over data
2. prepare data
   - fix type
   - fix errors
   - generate (for each user and for each month)
     - number of calls
     - minutes
     - texts
     - data used
     - COSTS
3. analyze data
   - summarize user behavior
   - build grafs
   - describe: dispersion, mean, std
4. test the hypothesis
   - profits are different for each plan
   - profits in "Moscow" are different from other regions
   - create your own "alpha" limit
   - null hypothesis, alternate hypothesis
   - which category was used for the hypothesis
5. write a report

(prices are shifted, because data is gather from other currency)
Phone plan "Smart":
- $550
- 500 min. of calls, 50 texts, 15 gb of data
- extra costs:
  - $3 per min.
  - $3 per text
  - $200 per gb of data

- $1950
- 3000 min. of calls, 1000 texts, 40 gb of data
- extra costs:
